A Jellyfin plugin that provides **fallback cover-image extraction** for book and audiobook libraries. It works alongside the official [Bookshelf plugin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-bookshelf) as a safety net: when built-in providers fail to find a cover -- or crash on mislabeled embedded art -- Book Cover steps in.

## Supported Formats

| Format | Type | Extraction Method |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| PDF | Book | First-page rendering via `pdftoppm` (poppler-utils) |
| EPUB | Book | Archive introspection with 3-tier image search |
| MP3 | Audiobook | Embedded art via `ffmpeg` raw stream copy |
| M4A / M4B | Audiobook | Embedded art via `ffmpeg` raw stream copy |
| FLAC | Audiobook | Embedded art via `ffmpeg` raw stream copy |
| OGG / Opus | Audiobook | Embedded art via `ffmpeg` raw stream copy |
| WMA | Audiobook | Embedded art via `ffmpeg` raw stream copy |
| AAC | Audiobook | Embedded art via `ffmpeg` raw stream copy |
| WAV | Audiobook | Embedded art via `ffmpeg` raw stream copy |
| Folder | Audiobook | Sidecar image lookup, then first-file embedded art |

## How It Works

### PDF -- First Page Rendering

The plugin shells out to `pdftoppm` (from poppler-utils) to render the first page of a PDF as a JPEG. DPI and JPEG quality are configurable. A per-process timeout prevents hangs on malformed files.

### EPUB -- 3-Tier Archive Search

EPUBs are ZIP archives. When the Bookshelf plugin fails to extract a cover, Book Cover opens the archive and searches with three strategies, in order:

1. **By filename** -- files explicitly named `cover`, `portada`, `front`, `frontcover`, or `book_cover` (with any image extension).
2. **By path** -- any image file with `cover` in its full archive path (e.g., `OEBPS/Images/cover-image.jpg`).
3. **By size** -- the largest image in the archive (above 5 KB, to skip icons and logos).

### Audio -- Raw Stream Copy with Magic-Byte Detection

Jellyfin's built-in Image Extractor uses ffmpeg to *decode* embedded artwork. This fails when the codec tag does not match the actual data -- a common problem in MP3 files where JPEG cover art is tagged as PNG in ID3 metadata.

Book Cover sidesteps this entirely by using `ffmpeg -vcodec copy` to **raw-copy** the embedded image stream without decoding. It then identifies the actual format by inspecting magic bytes:

| Magic Bytes | Detected Format |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `FF D8 FF` | JPEG |
| `89 50 4E 47` | PNG |
| `47 49 46` | GIF |
| `52 49 46 46 ... 57 45 42 50` | WebP |

Any leading null/padding bytes injected by the raw stream copy are stripped automatically.

### Folder-Based Audiobooks

For multi-file audiobooks stored as a directory of chapter files, the plugin:

1. Checks for sidecar images in the folder (`cover.jpg`, `folder.jpg`, `front.jpg`, `poster.jpg`, `thumb.jpg`).
2. Falls back to extracting embedded art from the first audio file in the directory.

## Installation

### From Releases

1. Download `book-cover.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/GeiserX/jellyfin-plugin-book-cover/releases/latest).
2. Extract `Jellyfin.Plugin.PdfCover.dll` into your Jellyfin plugins directory:
   ```
   <jellyfin-config>/plugins/PdfCover_3.0.0.0/Jellyfin.Plugin.PdfCover.dll
   ```
3. Restart Jellyfin.

### From Plugin Repository

Add the following repository URL in **Dashboard > Plugins > Repositories**:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeiserX/jellyfin-plugin-book-cover/main/manifest.json
```

Then install **Book Cover** from the plugin catalog and restart Jellyfin.

### Building from Source

```bash
dotnet build Jellyfin.Plugin.PdfCover/Jellyfin.Plugin.PdfCover.csproj -c Release
```

The compiled DLL will be at:
```
Jellyfin.Plugin.PdfCover/bin/Release/net9.0/Jellyfin.Plugin.PdfCover.dll
```

## Requirements

| Dependency | Required For | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Jellyfin 10.11+ | All features | Minimum supported server version |
| `poppler-utils` | PDF covers | Provides `pdftoppm`; not bundled with Jellyfin |
| `ffmpeg` | Audio covers | Bundled with Jellyfin Docker images |
| [Bookshelf plugin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-bookshelf) v13+ | EPUB covers | Recommended; handles standard EPUB covers as primary provider |

### Installing poppler-utils (Docker)

Add this to your `docker-compose.yml` entrypoint so `pdftoppm` is available at runtime:

```yaml
entrypoint:
  - /bin/bash
  - -c
  - |
    which pdftoppm > /dev/null 2>&1 || \
      (apt-get update -qq && \
       apt-get install -y -qq --no-install-recommends poppler-utils > /dev/null 2>&1 && \
       rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*)
    exec /jellyfin/jellyfin
```

## Configuration

After installation, configure the plugin in **Dashboard > Plugins > Book Cover**:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| DPI | 150 | Resolution for PDF first-page rendering. Higher values produce sharper covers at the cost of speed. |
| JPEG Quality | 85 | Output compression level (1--100). Lower values produce smaller files. |
| Timeout | 30 s | Maximum time allowed per extraction. Applies to both `pdftoppm` and `ffmpeg`. |

### Library Image-Fetcher Order

For the plugin to run during library scans, it must be enabled in each library's image-fetcher settings:

**Books library** (Image Fetchers for the Book type):

1. Epub Metadata *(Bookshelf plugin -- primary)*
2. Book Cover *(this plugin -- fallback)*

**Audiobooks library** (Image Fetchers for the AudioBook type):

1. Image Extractor *(Jellyfin built-in -- primary)*
2. Book Cover *(this plugin -- fallback for mislabeled embedded art)*

## Troubleshooting

**PDF covers are not extracted**
- Verify that `pdftoppm` is installed and accessible: run `which pdftoppm` inside the Jellyfin container.
- Check the Jellyfin log for `pdftoppm not found`.

**Audio covers are not extracted**
- Confirm `ffmpeg` is available: run `which ffmpeg` inside the container.
- Check the Jellyfin log for `ffmpeg not found`.

**Covers appear for some books but not others**
- The plugin only acts as a fallback. If a higher-priority provider already supplied a cover, this plugin will not run.
- To force re-extraction, delete the existing cover image for the item in Jellyfin and rescan the library.

**Extracted cover looks corrupted**
- This is rare but can happen if the embedded art stream contains unusual padding. Open an issue with the file format details and the Jellyfin log output.
